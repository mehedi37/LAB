## Overview

This Python script uses Newton's Forward Interpolation and Curve Fitting techniques to predict population growth over the next 10 years. It reads population data from a CSV file and performs analysis using symbolic mathematics and numerical optimization.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `sympy`

You can install them using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy sympy
